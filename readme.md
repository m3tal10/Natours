# Natours Application

Built using modern backend technologies: node.js, express, mongoDB, mongoose, and friends.

This is a fully functional backend-focused full-stack product-based application created with popular backend technologies.

Some of the key features of this application are:
*RESTful architechture.
*Search,sort,Field limit, pagination features.(yet to be implemented in the frontend but backend is fully functional.)
* Super secure authentication, authorization, and protocol to prevent many known types of security breaches such as XSS, CSRF, SQL injection, etc.
* Secure encryption of valuable information such as passwords, images, etc using Bcrypt and Sharp.
* Payment gateway integrations with Stripe and Stripe webhooks.
* Production-ready email handler that sends email on signup, and to recover forgotten passwords.
* Image upload functionality using Multer.
* Live interactive map on the tour details page using Mapbox.
* Robust error handling.

This is mainly a Backend project, but I tried to implement this initially using the PUG template engine. As this is a Backend-focused project, many of the features were not implemented in the front end. However, the API is fully functional.
The front end was implemented to present a demo of the work.

To test payment, use the following test card:
card no.: 4242 4242 4242 4242
exp. date: any
CVV: any

Notes:
* The front-end website might take a minute to render for the first time because of the limitation of the hosting platform.
* Use a VPN if the Stripe checkout page does not load. (This happens sometimes because of Stripe.)
